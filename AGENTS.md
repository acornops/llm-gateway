# LLM Gateway Agent Entry Point

Use this file as a map, not as the full source of truth. The repository knowledge base lives in the linked docs.

## Agent-Assisted Development

This repository supports human and agent-assisted development. When using a coding agent directly inside this repo, start from this repository root and read this file before editing files.

For work that touches multiple AcornOps repositories, start the agent from the
AcornOps workspace root instead. The workspace root is cloned from the
`acornops` repository and contains the cross-repo manifest, shared skills,
validation helpers, and PR coordination workflow.

## Start Here

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Docs Index](docs/index.md)
- [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [Operations Guide](docs/OPERATIONS.md)
- [Contracts](docs/contracts/README.md)
- [Design Notes](docs/design-docs/index.md)
- [Product Scope](docs/product-specs/index.md)
- [Plans](docs/PLANS.md)
- [Agent Handoff](docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md)
- [Quality Score](docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md)
- [Reliability Rules](docs/RELIABILITY.md)
- [Security Policy](docs/SECURITY.md)
- [Security Model](docs/security-model.md)

## Component Map

- `app/api`: FastAPI handlers for streaming, tool calls, and admin APIs
- `app/auth`: JWT and admin-token validation
- `app/llm`: normalized request model and provider adapters
- `app/mcp`: registry, transport, and broker path
- `app/config` and `app/db`: settings and storage integration

## Working Rules

- Treat `docs/` as the system of record for repository knowledge.
- Keep this file short. Push durable gateway rules and design context into linked docs instead of adding ad hoc instructions here.
- If a change affects control-plane or execution-engine contracts, update the mirrored contract docs and manifests in counterpart repos in the same change.
- If work spans multiple steps or design decisions, create an execution plan in `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
- Shared skills live in `.agents/skills/shared`; repository-owned skills live in `.agents/skills/local`.
- Agent tools may not auto-discover nested skills. When a task matches a skill description, open the relevant `SKILL.md` from `.agents/skills/shared` or `.agents/skills/local` before editing.
- Do not edit `.agents/skills/shared` here; update shared skills in the parent `acornops` repository and sync them into this repo.
- Follow [Agent Handoff](docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md) before final response, commit, or pull request handoff.
- Keep this harness vendor-neutral; do not add required vendor-specific instruction files.

## Required Validation

- `task python:check`
- `task contracts:check`
- `task harness:check`
- `task lint`
- `task validate`
- `task unit-test` in a provisioned environment when auth, provider, or MCP behavior changes

## High-Risk Areas

- JWT scope validation and admin-token validation
- Provider/model/tool allowlist enforcement
- Secret-backed MCP auth configuration
- NDJSON streaming normalization and MCP tool-call behavior

## Documentation Hygiene

- Document new or changed features in the same change; if docs do not change, include `Docs impact: none` and the reason in handoff evidence.
- Update [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) when adding or moving durable knowledge.
- Keep [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md) current when setup or runtime behavior changes.
- Keep [docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md](docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md) and [docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md](docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md) current when you discover lasting gaps.
